An evil witch hiding deep inside your computer is threatening the world's population by attempting to delete all the important information stored on the internet, first and foremost, cat videos!!

The elusive witch utilizes vulnerabilities of your operating system to trick your tools and perform its operations. But alas, M-Beam was developed for this very purpose. Reboot your machine into M-Beam and burn the witch for once and for all!

## Install Guide

You may use a virtual machine (convenient) or use real hardware (true experience).

- **VirtualBox:** Create a virtual PC with minimal CPU and RAM, add no hard drive and insert the ISO to use as the boot medium.

- **Qemu:** 'qemu-system-i386 -cdrom mbeam.iso'

- **Real Hardware:** If you wish to use a real computer, burn the ISO on a CD or a USB drive as a bootable medium. Keep the drive inserted and reboot your computer. On the boot menu, pick to boot from the newly burned drive instead of your SSD or HDD.
